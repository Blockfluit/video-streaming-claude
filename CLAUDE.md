# CLAUDE.md

Private, invite-only Netflix-style video library. **The full design is in [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) —
read it before implementing anything.** This file holds only what is easy to get wrong.

## Stack

Nuxt 4 + Vue 3 + `@nuxt/ui` (Tailwind 4) · NestJS 11 on Express · PostgreSQL 17 + Prisma 7 · ffmpeg/ffprobe
npm workspaces monorepo: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared`

## Environment

- WSL2 Ubuntu, repo on the **Linux filesystem** (`~/projects/...`). Never move it under `/mnt/c` — `inotify`
  does not fire reliably there and the ingest watcher depends on it.
- Node 24 via nvm (`.nvmrc`). Interactive shells load nvm automatically; **non-interactive shells do not**
  (Ubuntu's `.bashrc` returns early), so scripted commands need `. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` first.
- Docker via Docker Desktop WSL integration — there is **no** Linux docker engine in the distro. The whole
  toolchain (`docker`, `docker compose`, the socket) only exists while Docker Desktop is running on Windows;
  when it is not, `docker` resolves to Docker Desktop's shim and reports *"could not be found in this WSL 2
  distro"*, which reads like a missing install but is not one. Check `wsl.exe -l -v` for a **Running**
  `docker-desktop` distro, and start it with `"/mnt/c/Program Files/Docker/Docker/Docker Desktop.exe"`.
  A `permission denied` on `/var/run/docker.sock` is the different, rarer problem: it means the `docker`
  group is missing from the current shell's credentials (`id -nG`) and needs a new login, not a reinstall.
- ffmpeg 6.1.1 with libx264 is installed system-wide.

## Invariants — violating these causes bugs that are painful to trace

**Storage**
- `MEDIA_ROOT` (`media/`) holds source files and is watched. `DERIVED_ROOT` (`derived/`) holds thumbnails,
  posters and converted MP4/VTT and is **never** inside `media/` — generated output landing in the watched
  tree causes a watcher feedback loop.
- `storageKey` = archival source. `playbackKey` = converted MP4. Streaming serves `playbackKey ?? storageKey`.
- Videos with `sourceDeletedAt` set and a valid `playbackKey` are **exempt** from the missing-file sweep,
  or reclaiming disk space marks the library `MISSING`.
- Every storage key is `path.resolve`d and confirmed inside its root before use (path traversal).

**Media**
- Streaming must return **HTTP 206** with `Content-Range` for `Range` requests. `StreamableFile` alone does
  not do this, and without it the browser cannot seek.
- `thumbnailSource = MANUAL` is never overwritten by a reprobe. Auto-generation runs only when `AUTO`.
- `qualityLabel()` checks **width OR height**, never height alone — a 1080p film in 2.39:1 is `1920x800`.
- Badges render only at 1080p and above; below that, render nothing.
- chokidar needs `awaitWriteFinish`, or half-copied large files get ingested mid-write.
- Reconcile is keyed on `storageKey` and must stay idempotent — that is what stops uploads double-creating.

**Data**
- Prisma cannot express CHECK constraints. `ListItem`, `Credit`, and `WatchlistItem` each need a hand-added
  `CHECK ((collectionId IS NULL) <> (videoId IS NULL))` in their migration. Regenerating the init migration
  drops them — re-append them.
- Prisma 7 differs from 6 in ways that bite: the connection URL lives in `prisma.config.ts`, **not** in the
  schema's datasource block; the client needs a driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`); and the generator
  emits **TypeScript**, not compiled JS.
- That generated TypeScript must stay under `src/` (`output = "../src/prisma/generated"`). Emitted anywhere
  else it drags tsc's inferred `rootDir` up to `apps/api`, silently moving the entrypoint to
  `dist/src/main.js`. `prisma.config.ts` is excluded from `tsconfig.build.json` for the same reason.
- `$connect()` is **lazy** behind a driver adapter — it resolves fine with no database listening. Only a real
  query proves the connection, which is why `PrismaService` runs `SELECT 1` at boot.
- `BigInt` (`sizeBytes`) does not survive `JSON.stringify` — handle once at the response boundary.
- Postgres treats NULLs as distinct, so composite uniques containing nullable columns do not prevent
  duplicates. Enforce those in the service layer.
- `ListItem.position` is deliberately not unique — a unique index collides during drag-reordering.

**Frontend**
- During SSR, `useFetch`/`$fetch` run in Nitro and do **not** forward the browser cookie. Pass
  `headers: useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])` — wrap it once in a `useApi()` composable.
- Everything is same-origin via the Nuxt `/api/**` proxy. Keep it that way: a cross-origin `<track>` fails
  silently, and `<video>`/`<track>` cannot send `Authorization` headers (this is why auth is cookie-based).
- Upload progress needs `XMLHttpRequest`; `fetch` still gives no upload progress events.

**Access control**
- `USER` sees only `PUBLISHED` records. Enforce with a shared Prisma `where` helper in services, never in
  the UI alone.
- Refuse to demote or deactivate the last active admin.
- `SessionGuard` is registered globally, so access is fail-closed: a new route is protected the moment it
  exists. Opt out with `@Public()` — never by leaving a guard off.
- The session stores **only** `userId`; the user is re-read on every request. Do not cache the role in the
  session, or deactivating an account stops taking effect until the cookie expires.
- Login regenerates the session id (fixation) and `/auth/login` answers the same way for an unknown account
  as for a wrong password. Both are covered by `test/auth.e2e-spec.ts`.
- Login identity is **username**, not email — there is no email column. Usernames are stored lowercase, so
  every lookup and every write must go through `normaliseUsername()`; querying the raw input makes login
  silently case-sensitive. `displayName` is what gets rendered and is seeded from the username as typed.

## Conventions

- Pure logic (`path-parser`, subtitle matcher, `qualityLabel`, `needsConversion`) lives in testable functions
  with unit tests written **before** the code that calls them. These are the highest-risk, cheapest-to-test parts.
- Validation: `class-validator` DTOs in the API are the source of truth; `packages/shared` exports types only.
- Commit at each checkpoint in the plan's build order, not in one large batch.
